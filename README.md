For my final project at the Nashville Software School, I am mapping the distance and elevation between Nashville's 
BCycle stations. Ultimately, I'd like for the user to be able to select their station, and then select a route that
ends at another station based on distance, elevation, and points of interest. 

For this project, I am using the Foundation framework and the Google Maps API.

At this stage, the map is displaying routes to and from each BCycle station after the user selects two stations and
clicks the Get Route button.
