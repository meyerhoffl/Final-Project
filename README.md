JavaScript Capstone Project
==========================

For my final project at the Nashville Software School, I am mapping the distance and elevation between Nashville's 
BCycle stations. Ultimately, I'd like for the user to be able to select their station, and then select a route that
ends at another station based on distance, elevation, and points of interest. 

For this project, I am using the Foundation framework and the Google Maps API.

At this stage, the map is displaying routes to BCycle stations based on the users selection of their station and the
distance that they would like to ride. It is also entering the coordinates for the user's station into the drawPath function, which takes 5 elevation samples along the route. Currently, these samples
are just being displayed in the console log.

For the sake of finishing the project before March 27, I have modified my original goal, and I am working on
a function that would enable the user to click a button next to the route they want and display the elevation
stats for that route. 

I've added a branch to this project called elevation to continue working on the original goal, sorting routes by distance
and elevation.
